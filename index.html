                <p class="me-auto">According to the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, there were over 1.6 million street children in Bangladesh in 2022. Street children in Bangladesh live in extreme poverty, and do not have sufficient access to human rights such as education, housing, healthcare, and protection. Your small amount of donation can help them a lot.</p>

                <p>For children, particularly in Dhaka, organised crime is a reality. Rather than receiving protection by those in authority, they have been led into a life of petty theft, sexual exploitation, drug taking, and are frequently subject to beatings, arrest and imprisonment. By donating you can give them a normal life.</p>
